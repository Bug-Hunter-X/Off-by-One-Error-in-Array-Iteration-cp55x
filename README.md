This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `FixedArray.java` provides the corrected version.  The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the array bounds. This can lead to runtime exceptions. The solution emphasizes the importance of carefully checking loop conditions when working with arrays.
